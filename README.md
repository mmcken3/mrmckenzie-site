# Mitchell McKenzie Personal Website

This is a personal website for Mitchell McKenzie, which is myself. As a back end engineer I used a lot of bootstrap and templating tech to make this look better. However, if you are interested in seeing the email and twilio integration I used for the contact form check out my [Email Api](https://github.com/mmcken3/email-api).

This website has been rebuild using GatsbyJS and you can check out the repo it is stored in [here](https://github.com/mmcken3/mrmckenzie-gatsby-site).
