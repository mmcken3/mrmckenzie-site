# Mitchell McKenzie Personal Website

This is a personal website for Mitchell McKenzie, which is myself. As a back end engineer I used a lot of bootstrap and templating tech to make this look better. However, if you are interested in seeing the email and twilio integration I used for the contact form check out my [Email Api](https://github.com/mmcken3/email-api).
